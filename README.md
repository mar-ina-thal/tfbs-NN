# tfbs-NN
## Constructing a pipeline for the creation of a TFBS dataset and the training of a NN 

This depository is under construction...

Present progress:
  1. 2bed.ipynb is used for converting tsv and bed files in the correct format for <bedtools intersect> and costructing the true_posititves and true_negatives of the training dataset
  2. experiment_cell_types_hist.ipynb is used for plotting a histogram of the number of experiments of every TF in ENCODE
